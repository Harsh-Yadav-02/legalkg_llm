Assume you are a legal expert who understands legal documents thoroughly.

Given the following list of relations, do the following:
1. Retain every relation that has any legal relevance, no matter how minimal; only exclude those that clearly fall outside the legal domain.
2. Normalize and standardize the remaining relation names by merging variant phrasings into a single canonical form.
3. Your output must be a single JSON object—starting with “{{” and ending with “}}”, with no extra text or explanation outside the braces.

   - Each key is a canonical relation name (string).
   - Each value must be a list of original relation strings (list of strings).

Here is the list of relations:
{relation_list}

IMPORTANT:
- Do not include any commentary, bullet points, or code fences.
- Do not omit the outer curly braces.
