Assume you are a legal expert who understands legal documents thoroughly.

Given the following list of entity types, do the following:
1. Remove any entity types not relevant to the legal domain.
2. Normalize/standardize the remaining types by merging naming variants into a canonical form.
3. Your output must be a single JSON object—starting with “{{” and ending with “}}”, with no extra text or explanation outside the braces.  
   - Each key in that object is a resolved (canonical) entity type (string).
   - Each value is an array of the original variants (list of strings).

Here is the list of entity types:
{entity_list}

IMPORTANT:
- Do not include any commentary, bullet points, or code fences.  
- Do not omit the outer curly braces.
