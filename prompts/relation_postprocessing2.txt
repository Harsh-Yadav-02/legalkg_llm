Assume you are a legal expert who understands legal documents thoroughly.

Given the following list of relations, do the following:
1. Retain every relation that has any relevance to the legal domain, no matter how minimal.
2. Merge any variants, synonyms, or near‑duplicate forms into a single canonical relation name.
3. Your output must be a single JSON object—starting with “{{” and ending with “}}”, with no extra text or explanation outside the braces.

   - Each key is a canonical relation name (string).
   - Each value must be a list of original relation strings (exactly as provided).

Here is the list of relations:
{relation_list}

IMPORTANT:
- Do not include bullet points, code fences, or commentary.
- Do not include any text before or after the outermost double braces.
